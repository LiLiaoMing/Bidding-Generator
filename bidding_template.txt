Profesional profile

Hello! My name is Octavian Cioaca and since 2006 I’m taking immediate advantage, often unethically of css and javascripts files.

Because I’m lazy, I work and adapt to new technologies quickly and effectively. I enjoy using design patterns and OO front-end application architecture to create modularized reusable code, complex user interactions and fascinating user journeys!

I like to develop 60FPS websites and high-quality software via TDD/BDD in iterative/agile software application development and work closely with development team members.

One important side of my workflow is to review products development strategy, establish goals and lead face-to-face brainstorming sessions with A-Level executives on the marketing, technical and design sides of client's business.

Frequently I’m taking ownership of the delivery, timeliness and quality of the module assigned while working on multiple projects at one time. I provide constructive criticism around wire-framing, creative, test setup and customer communication skills.
